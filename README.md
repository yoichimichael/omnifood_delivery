# Omnifood Meal Delivery Service
This is the final project for Jonas Schmedman's HTML/CSS course.

The queries.css file contains conditional styling tied to screen width.

The scripts.js file contains jQuery to control conditional styling tied to scrolling and button clicks

# External Libraries

Icons are sourced from Ionicons.

jQuery is sourced from a Google API.

HTML5shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.

# Internal Libraries

The Waypoints library is located in the node_modules folder. This sets a point while scrolling that triggers the navigation to become 'sticky,' which adds a class of this name to the <nav> element.
    
The animate.css is a styling library also in the node_modules folder. These are CSS animations applied to the nav bar menu clicks.
