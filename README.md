# Omnifood Meal Delivery Service
This is the final project for Jonas Schmedman's HTML/CSS course.

The queries.css file contains conditional styling tied to screen width.

The scripts.js file contains jQuery to control conditional styling tied to scrolling and button clicks.

This site is not currently hosted anywhere.

# External Libraries

Icons are sourced from Ionicons.

jQuery is sourced from a Google API.

HTML5shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.

# Internal Libraries

The Waypoints library is located in the node_modules folder. This sets a point while scrolling that triggers the navigation to become 'sticky,' which adds a class of this name to the <nav> element.
    
The animate.css is a styling library also in the node_modules folder. These are CSS animations applied to the nav bar menu clicks.

# PHP file

Note: since this website is not currently hosted, the php file stored in the resources directory does not do anything. If at a later point I end up hosting this site, I will update the php file to work properly with my domain.
