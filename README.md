# Omnifood Meal Delivery Service
This is the final project for Jonas Schmedman's HTML/CSS course.

The queries.css file contains conditional styling tied to screen width.

The scripts.js file contains jQuery to control conditional styling tied to scrolling and button clicks

# External Libraries

Icons are sourced from Ionicons.

jQuery is sourced from a Google API.

The Waypoints library was installed and is located in the node_modules folder. This sets a point while scrolling that triggers the navigation to become 'sticky,' which adds a class of this name to the <nav> element.
